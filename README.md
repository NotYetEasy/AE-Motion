>## Installation:
This project is currently offical **Windows** only unfortunately, this repository will be unable to assist any MacOS users any further. However with tinkering you might be able to get it to **build and work**. Steps to use the effects in After Effects:
1. Navigate to **C:\Program Files\Adobe\Common\Plug-ins** (Note, even if you installed After Effects on a **seperate drive** this directory will remain in your **C:\ Drive**)
2. Go inside the folder your After Effects version is of. **For example my version says 7.0.** So the directory would be: **C:\Program Files\Adobe\Common\Plug-ins\7.0 for me.** Your directory might depend. To find it if your confused just navigate inside the **largest folder in size/the latest updated folder.** You can press on the **Size Button/The Date Modified Button** at the top of the **folder directory.** From there go inside the **largest folder or the newest folder.** However you might also have **a single folder present,** in which case go inside it.
3. Navigate inside the **MediaCore** folder.
4. **Drag over** or more precisely **Insert** the Folder you downloaded from **Releases**. You can also **copy or cut** it into the directory.
5. Open After Effects, go to the **Effects and Presets Panel** and from there locate **DKT Effects** and use them. You have succesfully finished installation.
